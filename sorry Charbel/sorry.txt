I am sorry for the confusion with my Git repository. 
I assure you that I do know how to work with Git and manage repositories.
I was using one repo initially but I ran into a merge conflict. 
I tried to resolve it with some help but unfortunately things got more complicated 
I decided to create a new repository to get back on track
It was a tough experience but Iâ€™ve learned a lot from it  definitely the hard way 
and I now feel much more confident handling Git especially with merges and branching



This is the flow of git 


Creating the  main branch
git checkout -b main

then stage branch from main
git checkout -b stage

then dev branch from stage
git checkout -b dev

then login feature branch from dev
git checkout -b login

after finishing login feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add login feature"

git push origin login

git checkout dev
git merge login
git push origin dev

 ai feature branch from dev
git checkout -b ai

git add .
git commit -m "Add AI feature"
git push origin ai
git checkout dev
git merge ai
git push origin dev
